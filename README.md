# Text-Classification

This work represents a project for the clustering of text documents by keywords in Russian, in particular, patent abstracts. This is a clustering task. Algorithm testing is carried out in two stages. First, the results are analyzed on the trained sample, and then the clustering analysis is used for a new sample.
